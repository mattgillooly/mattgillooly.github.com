title: Juno's Impact, By the Data
---

Here's a quick recap of how we all collectively reacted to this week's Storm Juno.

Everyone in the northeast knows you need to stock up on the essentials before a blizzard, so it's interesting to see [what we bought](http://www.dailydot.com/business/online-orders-winter-storm-juno/) and [when we bought it](http://www.dunnhumby.com/how-snowmageddon-spikes-sales).

Unsurprisingly, many were determined not to waste an opportunity to [get wasted](http://www.dailydot.com/business/drizly-data-storm-juno/).
Perhaps these were the same people who managed to mangle their appendages ([People keep sticking their hands in snowblowers without turning them off first, data show](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/27/people-keep-sticking-their-hands-in-snowblowers-without-turning-them-off-first-data-show/?tid=sm_tw))

Many of those lucky enough to survive the Snowmageddon with their hands intact, opted to, well, mangle their other appendages ([Pornhub & Storm Juno](http://www.pornhub.com/insights/pornhub-storm-juno/), NSFW, but kind of surprisingly close to SFW).
